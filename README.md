# Product Landing Page

**Note**: currently in development (work in progress).

## About

This is a sample product landing page conforming to the HTML/CSS requirements
of [FCC]()'s [*Build a Product Landing
Page*](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page)
project, which is part of the [*Responsive Web Design
Certification*](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects)
program.

The HTML/CSS requirements are currently being tested using Pytest and Beautiful
Soup 4, to make sure they are not broken, while designing the web page.

## Running the tests

### Requirements for the tests

You'd need the libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file. You
can obtain them by running the following command in your terminal `pip install
-r requirements.txt`; however, please note this will install the libraries in
reference globally.

### Execute the tests

From your terminal, run the following command: `pytest --verbose`.

Unless more tests are scheduled to be written, all tests should pass.
